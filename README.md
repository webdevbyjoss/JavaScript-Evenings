## For speakers

2 people are needed as majors for each next meeting, who will highlight some particular topics in a little bit more details.

While preparing your materials for event please look into these values:

* presentation slides - suck, **live demos in browser - rock!**
* boring talk for more than 15 minutes - suck, **discussions, knowledge sharing and fun - rock!**
* "huge" experience in X - suck, **hacking with everything and digging into something new - rock!**


## Schedule

We decided to have a meeting once per month.
Next meeting is planned for **26 March 2013**

## Date and time planning strategy

ALWAYS agree dates with speakers as a priority

Avoid first and last working days of the week (no Monday/Friday events)

Avoid overlapping with dates like holidays, celebrations, other important events (like Metallica in Kiev), New Yar's eve

its a good practice to organize event at the end of working day, lets say **18:30**
